## 📌 What is the Cloth Assistant?

The **Cloth Assistant** is an automated WhatsApp-based shopping helper that makes buying clothes faster, easier, and more organized.

A user can:

* Send a picture or description of the clothing they want.
* Receive automated replies guiding them through options.
* Get responses instantly because the bot is fully automated.
* Avoid manual searching on different websites.

The system uses AI to understand images, text, colors, styles, and preferences.

## 🎯 Main Purpose

The Cloth Assistant solves three major problems:

1. **People waste time searching for clothes online.**
2. **Buyers struggle to compare prices from different sellers.**
3. **Clothing stores miss customers because they don’t respond fast enough.**

The bot solves these by giving quick, automated answers.

## 📲 How a User Interacts With the Bot

### **1. User says “Hi”**

Bot replies with a friendly welcome.

### **2. Bot provides simple options**

Examples:

* "Send a picture of what you want 🖼️"
* "Tell me the clothing type (polo, jeans, gown, sneakers, etc.)"
* “Do you want something cheap, mid‑range, or premium?”

### **3. Assistant analyzes request**

Using its AI models, the bot:

* Identifies the clothing (style, color, gender, brand, pattern)
* Compares with available vendor information

From there, the bot continues smoothly until the buyer finds what they want.
